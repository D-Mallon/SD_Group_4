Matt here. I'm posting about the way that we should use git for this project, since David asked about it. 
I'm assuming yout guys have done the basics (cloning the repository, etc...). This is a step by step guide for how you should approach and upload your work to github.

Step 1: Send a text in the Whatsapp group telling us what file you are working on. If two people work on the same file, it will be a pain to get the files straight again. Don't work on the same file as someone else until they've pushed to github.

Step 2: Open your command line. Naviagate to the project folder. Ensure that everything is working by typing "git status"

Step 3: Type "git pull" to get the most up-to-date version of the repository

Step 4: Type "git branch (insert branch name here)" to create a new branch where you will make all your changes

Step 5: Navigate to the new branch with "git checkout (insert branch name)"

Step 6: Make any changes to the file you are working on

Step 7: Type "git add --all" and "git commit -m "insert message here"" to add our files and commit like normal

Step 8: Navigate back to the main branch with "git checkout main"

Step 9: Merge you branch with main using "git merge (insert branch name)"

Step 10: Push to guthub with "git push"

Step 10: Delete the branch with "git branch --delete (insert branch name)"

Step 11: "git pull" to ensure that you are up to date with all changes.

Do this every time you make an edit so we don't get caught in a web of individual changes
