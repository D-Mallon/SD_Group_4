How to set up our Crontab

1. Go to terminal on the EC2

2. Type “crontab -e”

3. We may need to press “i” to start typing

4. 33 21 * * * echo "testing timer" >> /tmp/crontab_test1.txt was the sample I used. Need to trial it with our python code. Should be something like 

5 * * * * python /path/to/filename.py

Comment: this command below was the one I had to run on my test file

*/5 * * * * /Users/dmallon/opt/anaconda3/envs/COMP30830Project/bin/python /Users/dmallon/add_date.py

Command "which python" had to be run to give me the python link to input into the code.
